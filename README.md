### About

I have been developing myself in the fields of Information Security, Embedded Systems and Software Development, for more than 10 years. I like to work interdisciplinary and take part in all processes of a product from idea stage to product stage.

Now I'm part of Crosstech company that develops customized solutions for customers.
