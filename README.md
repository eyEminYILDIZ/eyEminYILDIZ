### About

I have been developing myself in the fields of Information Security, Embedded Systems, Software Development and DevOps, for more than 12 years. I like to work interdisciplinary and take part in all processes of a product from idea stage to product stage.

Now, I'm working as Engineering Manager at Tarim Kredi Teknoloji
